		<p>Video gaming as a popular form of leisure activity and its
			effect on cognition, brain function, and structure has come into
			focus in the field of neuroscience. Visuospatial cognition and
			attention seem to benefit the most, whereas for executive
			functions, memory, and general cognition, the results are
			contradictory. The particular characteristics of video games
			driving these effects remain poorly understood. We critically
			discuss major challenges for the existing research, namely, the
			lack of precise definitions of video gaming, the lack of
			distinct choice of cognitive ability under study, and the lack
			of standardized study protocols. Less research exists on neural
			changes in addition to cognitive changes due to video gaming.
			Existing studies reveal evidence for the involvement of similar
			brain regions in functional and structural changes. There seems
			to be a predominance in the hippocampal, prefrontal, and
			parietal brain regions; however, studies differ immensely, which
			makes a meta-analytic interpretation vulnerable. We conclude
			that theoretical work is urgently needed

		<p>The reported <em>potential</em> improvements in cognitive
			domains after
			training with video games are accompanied and potentially caused
			by underlying changes in brain function and brain structure.
			However, at present, even less research has been conducted
			focusing on neural changes in addition to cognitive changes due
			to video game play. Only a single review on this topic has
			recently been published. This review (in total covering 116
			articles) includes both cross-sectional designs in which
			habitual gamers are compared with participants who never or only
			seldom play video games and longitudinal intervention designs in
			which a randomized group is trained with a given video game and
			a control group is not. Moreover, it includes studies on video
			game-addicted populations. Here again, the challenge of the
			chosen control group becomes evident as effects cannot be
			attributed causally due to the tremendous heterogeneity of
			references chosen. <em>The general conclusion</em> might be
			along the
			lines of “video gaming has an effect on brain structure and
			function,” although the underlying mechanisms that drive these
			effects might not be inferred. To start with, including studies
			in reviews differing in design does have its place, but needs to
			be supplemented by studies or reviews allowing for more causal
			inferences on the long run. <b>Nevertheless, it seems that
				in brain
				regions particularly related to attention and to visual
				spatial
				skills, an improvement in terms of brain function and brain
				structure due to video game training can be observed</b>

		<p>Based on the discussion of the results and studies above, we
			conclude that <em>inferences will continue to alternate between
				the
				general notion of an effect of video gaming on cognition and
				related brain structure and function</em>, and the inability
			to make
			specific recommendations in the field of specific therapeutic
			use or detailed analyses of underlying mechanisms, structures,
			and processes in the brain. Although disappointing for some, for
			the sake of accuracy, to date there seems to be no other option
			than being specific. This is especially important in practical
			settings, in which video gaming is used therapeutically. To
			date, therapeutic use of video games has not been based on
			strong scientific evidence besides the general notion that
			somehow, some video games have some beneficial effects on
			cognition in some individuals.

			whether video games supercharge our brains or not, they are here
			to stay. So better make the most of it, play to win! <br>

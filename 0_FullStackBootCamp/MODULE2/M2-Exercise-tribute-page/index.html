  <!-- SYNOPSIS -->
  <h4 class="synopsis">
    Paul is often considered to be the most important person after
    Jesus in the history of Christianity. His epistles (letters) have
    had enormous influence on Christian theology, especially on the
    relationship between God the Father and Jesus, and on the mystical
    human relationship with the divine.

// Ask the user, "What operation would you like to perform?"

var readL = require("Which operation would you like to perform? ");


// Then the user enters one of these options: "/" "*" "-" "+"
// If the user enters an invalid character, print: "That is not a valid operation" and then restart the program
// After the user enters a valid operation, ask the user, "Please enter the first number"
// The user then enters the first number. If the user enters something that is not a number, print: “This is not a number” and then re-ask the question
// After a valid number is entered, ask the user, "Please enter the second number". Perform the same error handling as before
// Then create a function to perform the proper math operation and print the result as: "The result is: X" where "X" is the actual result

        Why are frogs important to the ecosystem?<br><br>

        1. They play an important role in the food chain.<br>

        Throughout their lifecycles, frogs have an important place in
        the food chain as both predators and prey. As tadpoles, they
        eat algae, helping regulate blooms and reducing the chances of
        algal contamination. Frogs are an important source of food for
        a variety of animals, including birds, fish, monkeys and
        snakes.<br>

        The disappearance of frogs can disturb an intricate food web
        with cascading effects felt throughout an entire ecosystem.<br><br>

        2. They are an indicator species.<br>

        Frogs need suitable land and freshwater habitats in order to
        survive. They also have highly permeable skin that can easily
        absorb bacteria, chemicals and other toxins. These traits make
        them susceptible to changes in the environment and great
        indicators of their environment's health.<br><br>

        3. They keep insect populations at bay.<br>

        Did we mention frogs eat insects? These include pesky bugs
        most people don't want to deal with, as well as adult
        mosquitoes and their larvae that can transmit diseases
        including Dengue fever, Malaria, West Nile fever and Zika.<br><br>

        4. Frogs are important in research.<br>

        Frogs have served as experimental animals throughout the
        history of science. They are used to understand biological
        phenomena in a variety of other animals, including how birds,
        mammals and reptiles reproduce, grow and develop.<br>

        In the 1920s, the African clawed frog was used to determine if
        a woman is pregnant. After being injected with urine, if the
        frog produced eggs within 24 hours, the woman was pregnant.
        For Donnelly, frogs have afforded her a lifetime of discovery
        and opportunities to learn.<br>

        5. Frogs are nature's pharmacy.<br><br>

        Epibatidine, a painkiller 200 times more potent than morphine,
        is made by some poison dart frogs. Unfortunately, people can't
        safely ingest it because it's so toxic. But because frog
        toxins are so diverse, they are being researched for their
        potential as therapeutic drugs.<br>

        Frogs have existed for nearly 300 million years, but they are
        threatened by disease, pollution, habitat loss, invasive
        species and climate change. Their populations have declined
        dramatically since the 1950s, and it is believed more than 120
        species have already become extinct since 1980s.<br>

        For Donnelly, a world without frogs—and its cascading effects
        on people, animals and the environment—is one she does not
        want to know.<br>

        "Conservation must be a global team effort," she said. "We are
        the stewards of the planet and are responsible for all living
        creatures," she said. We should never have to justify why
        biodiversity matters."
